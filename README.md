## About
A version of the popular Arkanoid game, implemented as part of the OOP course I took in the first year of my studies in the University.  
The game contains three levels with increasing difficulty, in a GUI friendly platform.  
The game was implemented using the following OOP principals:  
- Polymorphism and inheritance.  
- Usage of basic design patterns in OOP, such as Observer, Builder, etc.  
- Usage of several generic collections and data structures such as linked lists and arraylists.  
- Working with GUI.
